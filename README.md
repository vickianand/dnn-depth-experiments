# Understanding effect of depth in neural network models

For understanding the impact of depth as a hyper-parameter for neural network models, we experimented with different model architectures and input representations for image classification (on CIFAR10 dataset) and sentiment analysis (on Large Scale Movie Dataset).

This project was done as the course project for IFT6390 course at UdeM in fall'18, taught by [prof. Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/).

## The project is divided in three sub-parts -

1. Sentiment analysis - in `sentiment-analysis` folder.
2. CIFAR10 classification - in `CIFAR10-classification` folder.
3. HoG and SIFT feature representation experiments - All the details are in a single jupyter notebook (HoG-SIFT-exps.ipynb.ipynb).
