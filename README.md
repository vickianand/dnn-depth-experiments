# Understanding effect of depth in neural network models
For understanding  the  impact  of depth  as  a  hyper-parameter for  neural  network  models,we  experimented  with  different  model  architectures  and  input  representations  for  imageclassification (on CIFAR10 dataset) and sentiment analysis (on Large Scale Movie Dataset).

This project was done as the course project for IFT6390 course at UdeM, taught by [prof. Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/).

## The project is divided in three sub-parts -
1. Sentiment analysis - in `sentiment-analysis` folder.
2. CIFAR10 classification - in `CIFAR10-classification` folder.
3. HoG and SIFT feature representation experiments - All the details are in a single jupyter notebook (HoG-SIFT-exps.ipynb.ipynb).
